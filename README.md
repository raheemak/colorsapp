# ColorsApp

This is an application built with MongoDB (on cloud- Atlas), React JS, and Node JS (Express). 

The functionality of the app is as follows: 
- Feature for users to add new group, person and color to the database (via an UI). If a personâ€™s name already exists, replace the input color as the color for that person
- Feature for users to retrieve all people for a particular color. Color can be selected from a pre-populated drop down list retrieved from DB. If no color is selected, display all the people organized by color and group.

## Assumptions

- Input json only needs to be read in the beginning, if you wish to use it, update the file and comment out the line in index.js 
- It is okay to display colors in lower case. This was done so that I could alleviate errors when use enters a new person/color 
- Do not need to validate if user entered color is a valid color 
- Object structure needed to stay the same in mongodb (could not use subdocuments). 
- Treat users with different capitals as the same user (ex: RaHeemA === Raheema)
- When updating a user color, if the group entered is different than their current group, disregard new group update and keep old group name.
