Develop RESTful APIs to handle the following:
• Feature for users to add new group, person and color to the database (via an UI). If a person’s name already exists, replace the input color as the color for that person
• Feature for users to retrieve all people for a particular color. Color can be selected from a pre-populated drop down list retrieved from DB. If no color is selected, display all the people organized by color and group.
 

Things to note:
• Ensure that proper security mechanism is implemented for your APIs
• Please include automated unit testing & indicate what your code coverage % is.
• Bonus points for Docker/container deployment.
• State any assumptions that you make on the logics/rules.
• Organize your code in your own personal Github & send the link to the repo with detailed instruction on how to setup & run the application.

I used MongoDB on cloud: Atlas 

To view app: https://colorsappraheema.herokuapp.com/
To run app locally: download repository and do npm start 

assumptions: 

- input json only needs to be read in the beginning, if you wish to use it, update the file and comment out the line in index.js 
- it is okay to display colors in lower case. this was done so that I could alleviate errors when use enters a new person/color 
- do not need to validate if user entered color is a valid color 
- object structure needed to stay the same in mongodb (could not use subdocuments). 
- treat users with different capitals as the same user
